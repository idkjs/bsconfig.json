# bsconfig.json

```
npx bsconfig.json

? Pick the framework you're using: 
 ‚ùØ apollo 
  basic 
  generator 
  minimal 
  node 
  react-hooks 
  react-native 
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

The options are the same ones as the `bsconfig.json` file you would have generated by running `bsb -init my-project -theme basic` plus a few other I got sick of writing out like for `reason-apollo-client` and `graphql-ppx` projects.
